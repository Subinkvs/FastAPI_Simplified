# ============================================
# NOTE: WHAT IS A SERVER
# ============================================
# A server is a computer or environment where your code runs
# so that it can respond to requests from other computers or programs (clients).
#
# Key points:
# 1. Your code executes on the server, not directly on the user's device.
# 2. The server listens for requests (like opening a website or API call).
# 3. Upon receiving a request, the server executes your code and sends back a response.
# 4. Servers can be:
#    - Physical machines
#    - Virtual machines
#    - Cloud servers (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)
#    - Local machine (for development/testing)
#
# Example:
# - You create a FastAPI app.
# - When a user visits your endpoint, the server runs your FastAPI code
#   and sends the result back to the user's browser.
#
# Analogy:
# - Server is like a kitchen in a restaurant.
#   The client (user) orders food (request), and the kitchen (server) prepares and serves it (response).
